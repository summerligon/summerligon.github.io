Hi! I am Summer Ligon - a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Emory University. I recieved a B.S. in economics and a minor in mathematics from Georgia College & State University. After spending a year in Georgia Tech's M.S. in economics program, I got accepted into Emory. My research interests include education policy using econometric analyses.
