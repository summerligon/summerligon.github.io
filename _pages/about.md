Hi! I am Summer Ligon - a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Emory University. I recieved a B.S. in economics and a minor in mathematics from Georgia College & State University. After a year in Georgia Techâ€™s M.S. in Economics program, I was accepted into Emory, marking the start of a transformative journey. 

My research focuses on education policy using econometric methods.
